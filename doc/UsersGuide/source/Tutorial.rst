This chapter walks users through experiment configuration options for various severe weather events. It assumes that users have already (1) :ref:`built the SRW App <BuildSRW>` successfully and (2) run the out-of-the-box case contained in ``config.community.yaml`` (and copied to ``config.yaml`` in :numref:`Step %s <QuickBuildRun>` or :numref:`Step %s <UserSpecificConfig>`) to completion. 

Users can run through the entire set of tutorials or jump to the one that interests them most. The five tutorials address different skills:

Sample Forecast #1: Severe Weather Over Indianapolis
=======================================================

**Objective:** Modify physics options and compare forecast outputs for similar experiments using the graphics plotting task. 

Weather Summary
--------------------

A surface boundary associated with a vorticity maximum over the northern Great Plains moved into an unstable environment over Indianapolis, which led to the development of isolated severe thunderstorms before it congealed into a convective line. The moist air remained over the southern half of the area on the following day. The combination of moist air with daily surface heating resulted in isolated thunderstorms that produced small hail. 

**Weather Phenomena:** Numerous tornado and wind reports (6/15) and hail reports (6/16)

Data
-------

On `Level 1 <https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-srweather-app/wiki/Supported-Platforms-and-Compilers>`__ systems, users can find data for the Indianapolis Severe Weather Forecast in the usual input model data locations (see :numref:`Section %s <DataLocations>` for a list). The data can also be downloaded from the `UFS SRW Application Data Bucket <https://noaa-ufs-srw-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html>`__. 

   * FV3GFS data for the first forecast (``control``) is located at: 
   
      * https://noaa-ufs-srw-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#input_model_data/FV3GFS/grib2/2019061518/

Load the Regional Workflow
-------------------------------

To load the regional workflow environment, source the lmod-setup file. Then load the workflow conda environment. From the ``ufs-srweather-app`` directory, run:

.. code-block:: console
   
   source etc/lmod-setup.sh <platform>       # OR: source etc/lmod-setup.csh <platform> when running in a csh/tcsh shell
   module use /path/to/ufs-srweather-app/modulefiles
   module load wflow_<platform>

where ``<platform>`` is a valid, lowercased machine name (see ``MACHINE`` in :numref:`Section %s <user>` for valid values). 

After loading the workflow, users should follow the instructions printed to the console. Usually, the instructions will tell the user to run ``conda activate regional_workflow``. For example, a user on Hera with permissions on the ``nems`` project may issue the following commands to load the regional workflow (replacing ``User.Name`` with their actual username):

.. code-block:: console
   
   source /scratch1/NCEPDEV/nems/User.Name/ufs-srweather-app/etc/lmod-setup.sh hera
   module use /scratch1/NCEPDEV/nems/User.Name/ufs-srweather-app/modulefiles
   module load wflow_hera
   conda activate regional_workflow

Configuration
-------------------------

Navigate to the ``ufs-srweather-app/ush`` directory. The default (or "control") configuration for this experiment is based on the ``config.community.yaml`` file in that directory. Users can copy this file into ``config.yaml`` if they have not already done so:

.. code-block:: console

   cd /path/to/ufs-srweather-app/ush
   cp config.community.yaml config.yaml

Users can save the location of the ``ush`` directory in an environment variable (``$USH``). This makes it easier to navigate between directories later. For example:

.. code-block:: console

   export USH=/path/to/ufs-srweather-app/ush

Users should substitute ``/path/to/ufs-srweather-app/ush`` with the actual path on their system. As long as a user remains logged into their system, they can run ``cd $USH``, and it will take them to the ``ush`` directory. The variable will need to be reset for each login session. 

Experiment 1: Control
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Edit the configuration file (``config.yaml``) to include the variables and values in the sample configuration excerpts below. 

.. Hint:: 
   
   To open the configuration file in the command line, users may run the command:

   .. code-block:: console

      vi config.yaml

   To modify the file, hit the ``i`` key and then make any changes required. To close and save, hit the ``esc`` key and type ``:wq`` to write the changes to the file and exit/quit the file. Users may opt to use their preferred code editor instead.

Start in the ``user:`` section and change the ``MACHINE`` and ``ACCOUNT`` variables. For example, when running on a personal MacOS device, users might set:

.. code-block:: console

   user:
      RUN_ENVIR: community
      MACHINE: macos
      ACCOUNT: none

For a detailed description of these variables, see :numref:`Section %s <user>`.

Users do not need to change the ``platform:`` section of the configuration file for this tutorial. The default parameters in the ``platform:`` section pertain to METplus verification, which is not addressed here. For more information on verification, see :numref:`Chapter %s <VXCases>`.

In the ``workflow:`` section of ``config.yaml``, update ``EXPT_SUBDIR`` and ``PREDEF_GRID_NAME``.

.. code-block:: console

   workflow:
     USE_CRON_TO_RELAUNCH: false
     EXPT_SUBDIR: control
     CCPP_PHYS_SUITE: FV3_GFS_v16
     PREDEF_GRID_NAME: SUBCONUS_Ind_3km
     DATE_FIRST_CYCL: '2019061518'
     DATE_LAST_CYCL: '2019061518'
     FCST_LEN_HRS: 12
     PREEXISTING_DIR_METHOD: rename
     VERBOSE: true
     COMPILER: intel

.. _CronNote:

.. note::

   Users may also want to set ``USE_CRON_TO_RELAUNCH: true`` and add ``CRON_RELAUNCH_INTVL_MNTS: 3``. This will automate submission of workflow tasks when running the experiment. However, not all systems have :term:`cron`. 

``EXPT_SUBDIR:`` This variable can be changed to any name the user wants. This tutorial uses ``control`` to establish a baseline, or "control", forecast. Users can choose any name they want, from "gfsv16_physics_fcst" to "forecast1" to "a;skdfj". However, the best names will indicate useful information about the experiment. For example, this tutorial helps users to compare the output from two different forecasts: one that uses the FV3_GFS_v16 physics suite and one that uses the FV3_RRFS_v1beta physics suite. Therefore, "gfsv16_physics_fcst" could be a good alternative directory name.

``PREDEF_GRID_NAME:`` This experiment uses the SUBCONUS_Ind_3km grid, rather than the default RRFS_CONUS_25km grid. The SUBCONUS_Ind_3km grid is a high-resolution grid (with grid cell size of approximately 3km) that covers a small area of the U.S. centered over Indianapolis, IN. For more information on this grid, see :numref:`Section %s <SUBCONUS_Ind_3km>`.

For a detailed description of other ``workflow:`` variables, see :numref:`Section %s <workflow>`.

To turn on the plotting for the experiment, the YAML configuration file
should be included in the ``rocoto:taskgroups:`` section, like this:

.. code-block:: console

  rocoto:
    tasks:
      taskgroups: '{{ ["parm/wflow/prep.yaml", "parm/wflow/coldstart.yaml", "parm/wflow/post.yaml", "parm/wflow/plot.yaml"]|include }}'


For more information on how to turn on/off tasks in the worklfow, please
see :numref:`Section %s <DefineWorkflow>`

In the ``task_get_extrn_ics:`` section, add ``USE_USER_STAGED_EXTRN_FILES`` and ``EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_ICS``. Users will need to adjust the file path to reflect the location of data on their system (see :numref:`Section %s <Data>` for locations on `Level 1 <https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-srweather-app/wiki/Supported-Platforms-and-Compilers>`__ systems). 

.. code-block:: console

   task_get_extrn_ics:
     EXTRN_MDL_NAME_ICS: FV3GFS
     FV3GFS_FILE_FMT_ICS: grib2
     USE_USER_STAGED_EXTRN_FILES: true
     EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_ICS: /path/to/UFS_SRW_App/develop/input_model_data/FV3GFS/grib2/${yyyymmddhh}

For a detailed description of the ``task_get_extrn_ics:`` variables, see :numref:`Section %s <task_get_extrn_ics>`.

Similarly, in the ``task_get_extrn_lbcs:`` section, add ``USE_USER_STAGED_EXTRN_FILES`` and ``EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_LBCS``. Users will need to adjust the file path to reflect the location of data on their system (see :numref:`Section %s <Data>` for locations on Level 1 systems). 

.. code-block:: console

   task_get_extrn_lbcs:
     EXTRN_MDL_NAME_LBCS: FV3GFS
     LBC_SPEC_INTVL_HRS: 6
     FV3GFS_FILE_FMT_LBCS: grib2
     USE_USER_STAGED_EXTRN_FILES: true
     EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_LBCS: /path/to/UFS_SRW_App/develop/input_model_data/FV3GFS/grib2/${yyyymmddhh}

For a detailed description of the ``task_get_extrn_lbcs:`` variables, see :numref:`Section %s <task_get_extrn_lbcs>`. 

Users do not need to modify the ``task_run_fcst:`` section for this tutorial. 

Lastly, in the ``task_plot_allvars:`` section, add ``PLOT_FCST_INC: 6`` and  ``PLOT_DOMAINS: ["regional"]``. Users may also want to add ``PLOT_FCST_START: 0`` and ``PLOT_FCST_END: 12`` explicitly, but these can be omitted since the default values are the same as the forecast start and end time respectively. 

.. code-block:: console

   task_plot_allvars:
     COMOUT_REF: ""
     PLOT_FCST_INC: 6
     PLOT_DOMAINS: ["regional"]

``PLOT_FCST_INC:`` This variable indicates the forecast hour increment for the plotting task. By setting the value to ``6``, the task will generate a ``.png`` file for every 6th forecast hour starting from 18z on June 15, 2019 (the 0th forecast hour) through the 12th forecast hour (June 16, 2019 at 06z).

``PLOT_DOMAINS:`` The plotting scripts are designed to generate plots over the entire CONUS by default, but by setting this variable to ["regional"], the experiment will generate plots for the smaller SUBCONUS_Ind_3km regional domain instead. 

After configuring the forecast, users can generate the forecast by running:

.. code-block:: console

   ./generate_FV3LAM_wflow.py

To see experiment progress, users should navigate to their experiment directory. Then, use the ``rocotorun`` command to launch new workflow tasks and ``rocotostat`` to check on experiment progress. 

.. code-block:: console

   cd /path/to/expt_dirs/control
   rocotorun -w FV3LAM_wflow.xml -d FV3LAM_wflow.db -v 10
   rocotostat -w FV3LAM_wflow.xml -d FV3LAM_wflow.db -v 10

Users will need to rerun the ``rocotorun`` and ``rocotostat`` commands above regularly and repeatedly to continue submitting workflow tasks and receiving progress updates. 

.. note::

   When using cron to automate the workflow submission (as described :ref:`above <CronNote>`), users can omit the ``rocotorun`` command and simply use ``rocotostat`` to check on progress periodically. 

Users can save the location of the ``control`` directory in an environment variable (``$CONTROL``). This makes it easier to navigate between directories later. For example:

.. code-block:: console

   export CONTROL=/path/to/expt_dirs/control

Users should substitute ``/path/to/expt_dirs/control`` with the actual path on their system. As long as a user remains logged into their system, they can run ``cd $CONTROL``, and it will take them to the ``control`` experiment directory. The variable will need to be reset for each login session. 

Experiment 2: Test
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once the control case is running, users can return to the ``config.yaml`` file (in ``$USH``) and adjust the parameters for a new forecast. Most of the variables will remain the same. However, users will need to adjust ``EXPT_SUBDIR`` and ``CCPP_PHYS_SUITE`` in the ``workflow:`` section as follows:

.. code-block:: console

   workflow:
     EXPT_SUBDIR: test_expt
     CCPP_PHYS_SUITE: FV3_RRFS_v1beta

``EXPT_SUBDIR:`` This name must be different than the ``EXPT_SUBDIR`` name used in the previous forecast experiment. Otherwise, the first forecast experiment will be overwritten. ``test_expt`` is used here, but the user may select a different name if desired. 

``CCPP_PHYS_SUITE:`` The FV3_RRFS_v1beta physics suite was specifically created for convection-allowing scales and is the precursor to the operational physics suite that will be used in the Rapid Refresh Forecast System (:term:`RRFS`). 

.. hint:: 
   
   Later, users may want to conduct additional experiments using the FV3_HRRR and FV3_WoFS_v0 physics suites. Like FV3_RRFS_v1beta, these physics suites were designed for use with high-resolution grids for storm-scale predictions. 

Next, users will need to modify the data parameters in ``task_get_extrn_ics:`` and ``task_get_extrn_lbcs:`` to use HRRR and RAP data rather than FV3GFS data. Users will need to change the following lines in each section:

.. code-block:: console

   task_get_extrn_ics:
     EXTRN_MDL_NAME_ICS: HRRR
     EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_ICS: /path/to/UFS_SRW_App/develop/input_model_data/HRRR/${yyyymmddhh}
   task_get_extrn_lbcs:
     EXTRN_MDL_NAME_LBCS: RAP
     EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_LBCS: /path/to/UFS_SRW_App/develop/input_model_data/RAP/${yyyymmddhh}
     EXTRN_MDL_LBCS_OFFSET_HRS: '-0'

HRRR and RAP data are better than FV3GFS data for use with the FV3_RRFS_v1beta physics scheme because these datasets use the same physics :term:`parameterizations` that are in the FV3_RRFS_v1beta suite. They focus on small-scale weather phenomena involved in storm development, so forecasts tend to be more accurate when HRRR/RAP data are paired with FV3_RRFS_v1beta and a high-resolution (e.g., 3-km) grid. Using HRRR/RAP data with FV3_RRFS_v1beta also limits the "spin-up adjustment" that takes place when initializing with model data coming from different physics.

``EXTRN_MDL_LBCS_OFFSET_HRS:`` This variable allows users to use lateral boundary conditions (LBCs) from a previous forecast run that was started earlier than the start time of the forecast being configured in this experiment. This variable is set to 0 by default except when using RAP data; with RAP data, the default value is 3, so the forecast will look for LBCs from a forecast started 3 hours earlier (i.e., at 2019061515 --- 15z --- instead of 2019061518). To avoid this, users must set ``EXTRN_MDL_LBCS_OFFSET_HRS`` explicitly. 

Add a section to ``config.yaml`` to increase the maximum wall time (``WTIME_RUN_POST``) for the postprocessing tasks. The wall time is the maximum length of time a task is allowed to run. On some systems, the default of 15 minutes may be enough, but on others (e.g., NOAA Cloud), the post-processing time exceeds 15 minutes, so the tasks fail. 

.. code-block:: console

   task_run_post:
     WTIME_RUN_POST: 00:20:00

Lastly, users must set the ``COMOUT_REF`` variable in the ``task_plot_allvars:`` section to create difference plots that compare output from the two experiments. ``COMOUT_REF`` is a template variable, so it references other workflow variables within it (see :numref:`Section %s <TemplateVars>` for details on template variables). ``COMOUT_REF`` should provide the path to the ``control`` experiment forecast output using single quotes as shown below:

.. code-block:: console

   task_plot_allvars:
     COMOUT_REF: '${EXPT_BASEDIR}/control/${PDY}${cyc}/postprd'

Here, ``$EXPT_BASEDIR`` is the path to the main experiment directory (named ``expt_dirs`` by default). ``$PDY`` refers to the cycle date in YYYYMMDD format, and ``$cyc`` refers to the starting hour of the cycle. ``postprd`` contains the post-processed data from the experiment. Therefore, ``COMOUT_REF`` will refer to ``control/2019061518/postprd`` and compare those plots against the ones in ``test_expt/2019061518/postprd``. 

After configuring the forecast, users can generate the second forecast by running:

.. code-block:: console

   ./generate_FV3LAM_wflow.py

To see experiment progress, users should navigate to their experiment directory. As in the first forecast, the following commands allow users to launch new workflow tasks and check on experiment progress. 

.. code-block:: console

   cd /path/to/expt_dirs/test_expt
   rocotorun -w FV3LAM_wflow.xml -d FV3LAM_wflow.db -v 10
   rocotostat -w FV3LAM_wflow.xml -d FV3LAM_wflow.db -v 10

.. note::

   When using cron to automate the workflow submission (as described :ref:`above <CronNote>`), users can omit the ``rocotorun`` command and simply use ``rocotostat`` to check on progress periodically. 

.. note::
   
   If users have not automated their workflow using cron, they will need to ensure that they continue issuing ``rocotorun`` commands to launch all of the tasks in each experiment. While switching between experiment directories to run ``rocotorun`` and ``rocotostat`` commands in both directories is possible, it may be easier to finish the ``control`` experiment's tasks before starting on ``test_expt``. 


Compare and Analyze Results
-----------------------------

Navigate to ``test_expt/2019061518/postprd``. This directory contains the post-processed data generated by the :term:`UPP` from the forecast. After the ``plot_allvars`` task completes, this directory will contain ``.png`` images for several forecast variables including 2-m temperature, 2-m dew point temperature, 10-m winds, accumulated precipitation, composite reflectivity, and surface-based CAPE/CIN. Plots with a ``_diff`` label in the file name are plots that compare the ``control`` forecast and the ``test_expt`` forecast. 

Copy ``.png`` Files onto Local System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users who are working on the cloud or on an HPC cluster may want to copy the ``.png`` files onto their local system to view in their preferred image viewer. Detailed instructions are available in the :ref:`Introduction to SSH & Data Transfer <SSHDataTransfer>`.

In summary, users can run the ``scp`` command in a new terminal/command prompt window to securely copy files from a remote system to their local system if an SSH tunnel is already established between the local system and the remote system. Users can adjust one of the following commands for their system:

.. code-block:: console

   scp username@your-IP-address:/path/to/source_file_or_directory /path/to/destination_file_or_directory
   # OR
   scp -P 12345 username@localhost:/path/to/source_file_or_directory path/to/destination_file_or_directory

Users would need to modify ``username``, ``your-IP-address``, ``-P 12345``, and the file paths to reflect their systems' information. See the :ref:`Introduction to SSH & Data Transfer <SSHDataTransfer>` for example commands. 

.. _ComparePlots:

Compare Images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The plots generated by the experiment cover a variety of variables. After downloading the ``.png`` plots, users can open and view the plots on their local system in their preferred image viewer. :numref:`Table %s <DiffPlots>` lists the available plots (``hhh`` corresponds to the three-digit forecast hour):

Each difference plotting ``.png`` file contains three subplots. The plot for the second experiment (``test_expt``) appears in the top left corner, and the plot for the first experiment (``control``) appears in the top right corner. The difference plot that compares both experiments appear at the bottom. Areas of white signify no difference between the plots. Therefore, if the forecast output from both experiments is exactly the same, the difference plot will show a white square (see :ref:`Sea Level Pressure <fcst1_slp>` for an example). If the forecast output from both experiments is extremely different, the plot will show lots of color. 

In general, it is expected that the results for ``test_expt`` (using FV3_RRFS_v1beta physics and HRRR/RAP data) will be more accurate than the results for ``control`` (using FV3_GFS_v16 physics and FV3GFS data) because the physics in ``test_expt`` is designed for high-resolution, storm-scale prediction over a short period of time. The ``control`` experiment physics is better for predicting the evolution of larger scale weather phenomena, like jet stream movement and cyclone development, since the cumulus physics in the FV3_GFS_v16 suite is not configured to run at 3-km resolution.

Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _fcst1_slp:

Sea Level Pressure
`````````````````````
In the Sea Level Pressure (SLP) plots, the ``control`` and ``test_expt`` plots are nearly identical at forecast hour f000, so the difference plot is entirely white. 

.. figure:: https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-srweather-app/wiki/fcst1_plots/slp_diff_regional_f000.png
      :align: center

      *Difference Plot for Sea Level Pressure at f000*

As the forecast continues, the results begin to diverge, as evidenced by the spattering of light blue dispersed across the f006 SLP difference plot. 

.. figure:: https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-srweather-app/wiki/fcst1_plots/slp_diff_regional_f006.png
      :align: center

      *Difference Plot for Sea Level Pressure at f006*

The predictions diverge further by f012, where a solid section of light blue in the top left corner of the difference plot indicates that to the northwest of Indianapolis, the SLP predictions for the ``control`` forecast were slightly lower than the predictions for the ``test_expt`` forecast.

      *Difference Plot for Sea Level Pressure at f012*

.. _fcst1_refc:

Composite Reflectivity
``````````````````````````

Reflectivity images visually represent the weather based on the energy (measured in decibels [dBZ]) reflected back from radar. Composite reflectivity generates an image based on reflectivity scans at multiple elevation angles, or "tilts", of the antenna. See https://www.weather.gov/jetstream/refl for a more detailed explanation of composite reflectivity.

At f000, the ``test_expt`` plot (top left) is showing more severe weather than the ``control`` plot (top right). The ``test_expt`` plot shows a vast swathe of the Indianapolis region covered in yellow with spots of orange, corresponding to composite reflectivity values of 35+ dBZ. The ``control`` plot radar image covers a smaller area of the grid, and with the exception of a few yellow spots, composite reflectivity values are <35 dBZ. The difference plot (bottom) shows areas where the ``test_expt`` plot (red) and the ``control`` plot (blue) have reflectivity values greater than 20 dBZ. The ``test_expt`` plot has significantly more areas with high composite reflectivity values. 

.. figure:: https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-srweather-app/wiki/fcst1_plots/refc_diff_regional_f000.png
      :align: center

      *Composite Reflectivity at f000*

As the forecast progresses, the radar images resemble each other more (see :numref:`Figure %s <refc006>`). Both the ``test_expt`` and ``control`` plots show the storm gaining energy (with more orange and red areas), rotating counterclockwise, and moving east. Thus, both forecasts do a good job of picking up on the convection. However, the ``test_expt`` forecast still indicates a higher-energy storm with more areas of *dark* red. It appears that the ``test_expt`` case was able to resolve more discrete storms over northwest Indiana and in the squall line. The ``control`` plot has less definition and depicts widespread storms concentrated together over the center of the state. 

.. _refc006:

.. figure:: https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-srweather-app/wiki/fcst1_plots/refc_diff_regional_f006.png
      :align: center

      *Composite reflectivity at f006 shows storm gathering strength*

At forecast hour 12, the plots for each forecast show a similar evolution of the storm with both resolving a squall line. The ``test_expt`` plot shows a more intense squall line with discrete cells (areas of high composite reflectivity in dark red), which could lead to severe weather. The ``control`` plot shows an overall decrease in composite reflectivity values compared to f006. It also orients the squall line more northward with less intensity, possibly due to convection from the previous forecast runs cooling the atmosphere. In short, ``test_expt`` suggests that the storm will still be going strong at 06z on June 15, 2019, whereas the ``control`` suggests that the storm will begin to let up.

Surface-Based CAPE/CIN
``````````````````````````

Background
""""""""""""

The National Weather Service (:term:`NWS`) defines Surface-Based Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) as "the amount of fuel available to a developing thunderstorm." According to NWS, CAPE "describes the instabilily of the atmosphere and provides an approximation of updraft strength within a thunderstorm. A higher value of CAPE means the atmosphere is more unstable and would therefore produce a stronger updraft" (see `NWS, What is CAPE? <https://www.weather.gov/ilx/swop-severetopics-CAPE>`__ for further explanation). 

According to the NWS `Storm Prediction Center <https://www.spc.noaa.gov/exper/mesoanalysis/help/begin.html>`__, Convective Inhibition (CIN) "represents the 'negative' area on a sounding that must be overcome for storm initiation." In effect, it measures negative buoyancy (-B) --- the opposite of CAPE, which measures positive buoyancy (B or B+) of an air parcel.

Interpreting the Plots
""""""""""""""""""""""""

CAPE measures are represented on the plots using color. They range in value from 100-5000 Joules per kilogram (J/kg). Lower values are represented by cool colors and higher values are represented by warm colors. In general, values of approximately 1000+ J/kg can lead to severe thunderstorms, although this is also dependent on season and location. 

CIN measures are displayed on the plots using hatch marks:

   * ``*`` means CIN <= -500 J/kg
   * ``+`` means -500 < CIN <= -250 J/kg
   * ``/`` means -250 < CIN <= -100 J/kg
   * ``.`` means -100 < CIN <= -25 J/kg

In general, the higher the CIN values are (i.e., the closer they are to zero), the lower the convective inhibition and the greater the likelihood that a storm will develop. Low CIN values (corresponding to high convective inhibition) make it unlikely that a storm will develop even in the presence of high CAPE. 

At the 0th forecast hour, the ``test_expt`` plot (below, left) shows lower values of CAPE and higher values of CIN than in the ``control`` plot (below, right). This means that ``test_expt`` is projecting lower potential energy available for a storm but also lower inhibition, which means that less energy would be required for a storm to develop. The difference between the two plots is particularly evident in the southwest corner of the difference plot, which shows a 1000+ J/kg difference between the two plots.

      *CAPE/CIN Difference Plot at f000*

At the 6th forecast hour, both ``test_expt`` and ``control`` plots are forecasting higher CAPE values overall. Both plots also predict higher CAPE values to the southwest of Indianapolis than to the northeast. This makes sense because the storm was passing from west to east. However, the difference plot shows that the ``control`` forecast is predicting higher CAPE values primarily to the southwest of Indianapolis, whereas ``test_expt`` is projecting a rise in CAPE values throughout the region. The blue region of the difference plot indicates where ``test_expt`` predictions are higher than the ``control`` predictions; the red/orange region shows places where ``control`` predicts significantly higher CAPE values than ``test_expt`` does.

      *CAPE/CIN Difference Plot at f006*

At the 12th forecast hour, the ``control`` plot indicates that CAPE may be decreasing overall. ``test_expt``, however, shows that areas of high CAPE remain and continue to grow, particularly to the east. The blue areas of the difference plot indicate that ``test_expt`` is predicting higher CAPE than ``control`` everywhere but in the center of the plot.

----------

Option 1: Adjust frequency of forecast plots.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For a simple extension of this tutorial, users can adjust ``PLOT_FCST_INC`` to output plots more frequently. For example, users can set ``PLOT_FCST_INC: 1`` to produce plots for every hour of the forecast. This would allow users to conduct a more fine-grained visual comparison of how each forecast evolved. 

Option 2: Compare output from additional physics suites.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Users are encouraged to conduct additional experiments using the FV3_HRRR and FV3_WoFS_v0 physics suites. Like FV3_RRFS_v1beta, these physics suites were designed for use with high-resolution grids for storm-scale predictions. Compare them to each other or to the control! 

Users may find the difference plots for :term:`updraft helicity` particularly informative. The FV3_GFS_v16 physics suite does not contain updraft helicity output in its ``diag_table`` files, so the difference plot generated in this tutorial is empty. Observing high values for updraft helicity indicates the presence of a rotating updraft, often the result of a supercell thunderstorm capable of severe weather, including tornadoes. Comparing the results from two physics suites that measure this parameter can therefore prove insightful.

Sample Forecast #2: Cold Air Damming
========================================

Weather Summary
-----------------

Cold air damming occurs when cold dense air is topographically trapped along the leeward (downwind) side of a mountain. Starting on February 3, 2020, weather conditions leading to cold air damming began to develop east of the Appalachian mountains. By February 6-7, 2020, this cold air damming caused high winds, flash flood advisories, and wintery conditions. 

**Weather Phenomena:** Cold air damming

Sample Forecast #3: Southern Plains Winter Weather Event
===========================================================

Weather Summary
--------------------

A polar vortex brought arctic air to much of the U.S. and Mexico. A series of cold fronts and vorticity disturbances helped keep this cold air in place for an extended period of time resulting in record-breaking cold temperatures for many southern states and Mexico. This particular case captures two winter weather disturbances between February 14, 2021 at 06z and February 17, 2021 at 06z that brought several inches of snow to Oklahoma City. A lull on February 16, 2021 resulted in record daily low temperatures.
