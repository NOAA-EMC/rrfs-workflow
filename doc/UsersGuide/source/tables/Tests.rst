Supported WE2E Tests
************************************************************

This table describes the Workflow End-to-end (WE2E) Tests, including which belong to which test suites (fundamental or comprehensive). Core hour and Walltime estimates are based on tests on the Hera machine with Intel compilers; other machines may take longer to run (especially depending on batch queue wait times), and GNU compilers may take significantly longer to run.
