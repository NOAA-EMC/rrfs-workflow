Building the SRW App
========================== 

The Unified Forecast System (:term:`UFS`) Short-Range Weather (SRW) Application is an :term:`umbrella repository` consisting of a number of different :ref:`components <Components>` housed in external repositories. Once the SRW App is built, users can configure experiments and generate predictions of atmospheric behavior over a limited spatial area and on time scales ranging from minutes out to several days. 

.. attention::

   The SRW Application has `four levels of support <https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-srweather-app/wiki/Supported-Platforms-and-Compilers>`__. The steps described in this chapter will work most smoothly on preconfigured (Level 1) systems. This chapter can also serve as a starting point for running the SRW App on other systems (including generic Linux/Mac systems), but the user may need to perform additional troubleshooting. 

.. note::
   The :ref:`container approach <QuickstartC>` is recommended for a smoother first-time build and run experience. Building without a container may allow for more customization. However, the non-container approach requires more in-depth system-based knowledge, especially on Level 3 and 4 systems, so it is less appropriate for beginners. 

To build the SRW App, users will complete the following steps:

   #. :ref:`Install prerequisites <HPCstackInfo>`
   #. :ref:`Clone the SRW App from GitHub <DownloadSRWApp>`
   #. :ref:`Check out the external repositories <CheckoutExternals>`
   #. :ref:`Set up the build environment and build the executables <BuildExecutables>`

.. _HPCstackInfo:

Install the Prerequisite Software Stack
==========================================

Currently, installation of the prerequisite software stack is supported via HPC-Stack. :term:`HPC-Stack` is a repository that provides a unified, shell script-based system to build the software stack required for `UFS <https://ufscommunity.org/>`__ applications such as the SRW App.

.. Attention::
   Skip the HPC-Stack installation if working on a `Level 1 system <https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-srweather-app/wiki/Supported-Platforms-and-Compilers>`__ (e.g., Cheyenne, Hera, Orion, NOAA Cloud), and :ref:`continue to the next section <DownloadSRWApp>`.

Background
----------------

The UFS Weather Model draws on over 50 code libraries to run its applications. These libraries range from libraries developed in-house at NOAA (e.g., NCEPLIBS, FMS) to libraries developed by NOAA's partners (e.g., PIO, ESMF) to truly third party libraries (e.g., netCDF). Individual installation of these libraries is not practical, so the `HPC-Stack <https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/hpc-stack>`__ was developed as a central installation system to ensure that the infrastructure environment across multiple platforms is as similar as possible. Installation of the HPC-Stack is required to run the SRW App.

Instructions
-------------------------
Users working on systems that fall under `Support Levels 2-4 <https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-srweather-app/wiki/Supported-Platforms-and-Compilers>`__ will need to install the HPC-Stack the first time they try to build applications (such as the SRW App) that depend on it. Users can either build the HPC-Stack on their local system or use the centrally maintained stacks on each HPC platform if they are working on a Level 1 system. Before installing the HPC-Stack, users on both Linux and MacOS systems should set the stack size to "unlimited" (if allowed) or to the largest possible value:

.. code-block:: console

   # Linux, if allowed
   ulimit -s unlimited

   # MacOS, this corresponds to 65MB
   ulimit -S -s unlimited

For a detailed description of installation options, see :ref:`Installing the HPC-Stack <InstallBuildHPCstack>`. 

.. attention::
   Although HPC-Stack is the fully-supported option as of the v2.1.0 release, UFS applications are gradually shifting to :term:`spack-stack`, which is a :term:`Spack`-based method for installing UFS prerequisite software libraries. The spack-stack is currently used on NOAA Cloud platforms and in containers, while HPC-Stack is still used on other Level 1 systems and is the software stack validated by the UFS Weather Model as of the v2.1.0 release. Users are encouraged to check out `spack-stack <https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/spack-stack>`__ to prepare for the upcoming shift in support from HPC-Stack to spack-stack. 

After completing installation, continue to the next section (:numref:`Section %s: Download the UFS SRW Application Code <DownloadSRWApp>`). 

.. _DownloadSRWApp:

Download the UFS SRW Application Code
======================================
The SRW Application source code is publicly available on GitHub. To download the SRW App code, clone the ``develop`` branch of the repository:

.. code-block:: console

   git clone -b develop https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-srweather-app.git

The cloned repository contains the configuration files and sub-directories shown in
:numref:`Table %s <FilesAndSubDirs>`. The user may set an ``$SRW`` environment variable to point to the location of the new ``ufs-srweather-app`` repository. For example, if ``ufs-srweather-app`` was cloned into the ``$HOME`` directory, the following commands will set an ``$SRW`` environment variable in a bash or csh shell, respectively:

.. code-block:: console

    export SRW=$HOME/ufs-srweather-app
    setenv SRW $HOME/ufs-srweather-app

.. _CheckoutExternals:

Check Out External Components
================================

The SRW App relies on a variety of components (e.g., UFS_UTILS, ufs-weather-model, and UPP) detailed in :numref:`Chapter %s <Components>` of this User's Guide. Each component has its own repository. Users must run the ``checkout_externals`` script to collect the individual components of the SRW App from their respective GitHub repositories. The ``checkout_externals`` script uses the configuration file ``Externals.cfg`` in the top level directory of the SRW App to clone the correct tags (code versions) of the external repositories listed in :numref:`Section %s <HierarchicalRepoStr>` into the appropriate directories (e.g., ``ush``, ``sorc``). 

Run the executable that pulls in SRW App components from external repositories:

.. code-block:: console

   cd </path/to/ufs-srweather-app/>
   ./manage_externals/checkout_externals

The script should output dialogue indicating that it is retrieving different code repositories. It may take several minutes to download these repositories.

To see more options for the ``checkout_externals`` script, users can run ``./manage_externals/checkout_externals -h``. For example:

   * ``-S``: Outputs the status of the repositories managed by ``checkout_externals``. By default only summary information is provided. Use with the ``-v`` (verbose) option to see details.
   * ``-x [EXCLUDE [EXCLUDE ...]]``: allows users to exclude components when checking out externals. 
   * ``-o``: By default only the required externals are checked out. This flag will also check out the optional externals.

Generally, users will not need to use the options and can simply run the script, but the options are available for those who are curious. 

.. _BuildExecutables:

Set Up the Environment and Build the Executables
===================================================

.. _DevBuild:

``devbuild.sh`` Approach
-----------------------------

On Level 1 systems for which a modulefile is provided under the ``modulefiles`` directory, users can build the SRW App binaries with the following command:

.. code-block:: console

   ./devbuild.sh --platform=<machine_name>

where ``<machine_name>`` is replaced with the name of the platform the user is working on. Valid values include: ``cheyenne`` | ``gaea`` | ``hera`` | ``jet`` | ``linux`` | ``macos`` | ``noaacloud`` | ``orion`` 

.. note::
   Although build modulefiles exist for generic Linux and MacOS machines, users will need to alter these according to the instructions in Sections :numref:`%s <CMakeApproach>` & :numref:`%s <MacLinuxDetails>`. Users on these systems may have more success building the SRW App with the :ref:`CMake Approach <CMakeApproach>` instead. 

If compiler auto-detection fails for some reason, specify it using the ``--compiler`` argument. For example:

.. code-block:: console

   ./devbuild.sh --platform=hera --compiler=intel

where valid values are ``intel`` or ``gnu``.

The last line of the console output should be ``[100%] Built target ufs-weather-model``, indicating that the UFS Weather Model executable has been built successfully. 

If users want to build the optional ``GSI`` and ``rrfs_utl`` components for :term:`RRFS`, they can pass the ``gsi`` and ``rrfs_utils`` arguments to ``devbuild.sh``. For example:

.. code-block:: console

   ./devbuild.sh -p=hera gsi rrfs_utils

.. note:: 
   RRFS capabilities are currently build-only features. They are not yet available for use at runtime. 

The last few lines of the RRFS console output should be: 

.. code-block:: console
   
   [100%] Built target RRFS_UTILS
   Install the project...
   -- Install configuration: "RELEASE"
   -- Installing: /path/to/ufs-srweather-app/exec/ufs_srweather_app.settings

After running ``devbuild.sh``, the executables listed in :numref:`Table %s <ExecDescription>` should appear in the ``ufs-srweather-app/exec`` directory. If users choose to build the ``GSI`` and ``rrfs_utils`` components, the executables listed in :numref:`Table %s <RRFSexec>` will also appear there. If the ``devbuild.sh`` build method does not work, or if users are not on a supported machine, they will have to manually set up the environment and build the SRW App binaries with CMake as described in :numref:`Section %s <CMakeApproach>`.

.. _CMakeApproach:

CMake Approach
-----------------

Set Up the Build Environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. attention::
   * If users successfully built the executables in :numref:`Table %s <ExecDescription>`, they should skip to step :numref:`Chapter %s <RunSRW>`.
   * Users who want to build the SRW App on MacOS or generic Linux systems should skip to :numref:`Section %s <MacLinuxDetails>` and follow the approach there. 

If the ``devbuild.sh`` approach failed, users need to set up their environment to run a workflow on their specific platform. First, users should make sure ``Lmod`` is the app used for loading modulefiles. This is the case on most Level 1 systems; however, on systems such as Gaea/Odin, the default modulefile loader is from Cray and must be switched to Lmod. For example, on Gaea, users can run one of the following two commands depending on whether they have a bash or csh shell, respectively:

.. code-block:: console

   source etc/lmod-setup.sh gaea
   source etc/lmod-setup.csh gaea

.. note::

   If users execute one of the above commands on systems that don't need it, it will not cause any problems (it will simply do a ``module purge``). 

From here, ``Lmod`` is ready to load the modulefiles needed by the SRW App. These modulefiles are located in the ``modulefiles`` directory. To load the necessary modulefile for a specific ``<platform>`` using a given ``<compiler>``, run:

.. code-block:: console

   module use <path/to/modulefiles>
   module load build_<platform>_<compiler>

where ``<path/to/modulefiles/>`` is the full path to the ``modulefiles`` directory. 

This will work on Level 1 systems, where a modulefile is available in the ``modulefiles`` directory. On Level 2-4 systems (including generic Linux/MacOS systems), users will need to modify certain environment variables, such as the path to HPC-Stack, so that the SRW App can find and load the appropriate modules. For systems with Lmod installed, one of the current ``build_<platform>_<compiler>`` modulefiles can be copied and used as a template. To check whether Lmod is installed, run ``echo $LMOD_PKG``, and see if it outputs a path to the Lmod package. On systems without Lmod, users can modify or set the required environment variables with the ``export`` or ``setenv`` commands, depending on whether they are using a bash or csh/tcsh shell, respectively: 

.. code-block::

   export <VARIABLE_NAME>=<PATH_TO_MODULE>
   setenv <VARIABLE_NAME> <PATH_TO_MODULE>

Note that building the SRW App without Lmod is not supported at this time. It should be possible to do so, but it has not been tested. Users are encouraged to install Lmod on their system. 

.. _BuildCMake:

Build the Executables Using CMake
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After setting up the build environment in the preceding section (by loading the ``build_<platform>_<compiler>`` modulefile), users need to build the executables required to run the SRW App. In the ``ufs-srweather-app`` directory, create a subdirectory to hold the build's executables: 

.. code-block:: console

   mkdir build
   cd build

From the build directory, run the following commands to build the pre-processing utilities, forecast model, and post-processor:

.. code-block:: console

   cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=.. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR=exec ..
   make -j 4  >& build.out &

``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` specifies the location where the ``exec``, ``include``, ``lib``, and ``share`` directories will be created. These directories will contain various components of the SRW App. Its recommended value ``..`` denotes one directory up from the build directory. In the next line, the ``make`` argument ``-j 4`` indicates that the build will run in parallel with 4 threads. Although users can specify a larger or smaller number of threads (e.g., ``-j 8``, ``-j 2``), it is highly recommended to use at least 4 parallel threads to prevent overly long installation times. 

The build will take a few minutes to complete. When it starts, a random number is printed to the console, and when it is done, a ``[1]+  Done`` message is printed to the console. ``[1]+  Exit`` indicates an error. Output from the build will be in the ``ufs-srweather-app/build/build.out`` file. When the build completes, users should see the forecast model executable ``ufs_model`` and several pre- and post-processing executables in the ``ufs-srweather-app/exec`` directory. These executables are described in :numref:`Table %s <ExecDescription>`. 

.. hint::

   If you see the ``build.out`` file, but there is no ``ufs-srweather-app/exec`` directory, wait a few more minutes for the build to complete.

.. _MacLinuxDetails:

Additional Details for Building on MacOS or Generic Linux
------------------------------------------------------------

.. note::
    Users who are **not** building the SRW App on MacOS or generic Linux platforms may skip to :numref:`Section %s <BuildExecutables>` to finish building the SRW App or continue to :numref:`Chapter %s <RunSRW>` to configure and run an experiment. 

The SRW App can be built on MacOS and generic Linux machines after the prerequisite software has been installed on these systems (via :term:`HPC-Stack` or :term:`spack-stack`). The installation for MacOS is architecture-independent and has been tested using both x86_64 and M1 chips (running natively). The following configurations for MacOS have been tested:

   #. MacBookPro 2019, 2.4 GHz 8-core Intel Core i9 (x86_64), Monterey Sur 12.1, GNU compiler suite v.11.3.0 (gcc, gfortran, g++); mpich 3.3.2 or openmpi/4.1.2
   #. MacBookAir 2020, M1 chip (arm64, running natively), 4+4 cores, Big Sur 11.6.4, GNU compiler suite v.11.3.0 (gcc, gfortran, g++); mpich 3.3.2 or openmpi/4.1.2
   #. MacBook Pro 2015, 2.8 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7 (x86_64), Catalina OS X 10.15.7, GNU compiler suite v.11.2.0_3 (gcc, gfortran, g++); mpich 3.3.2 or openmpi/4.1.2

Several Linux builds have been tested on systems with x86_64 architectures.

The ``./modulefiles/build_<platform>_gnu.lua`` modulefile (where ``<platform>`` is ``macos`` or ``linux``) is written as a Lmod module in the Lua language, and it can be loaded once the Lmod module environment has been initialized (which should have happened even prior to :ref:`installing HPC-Stack <HPCstackInfo>`). This module lists the location of the HPC-Stack modules, loads the meta-modules and modules, sets serial and parallel compilers, additional flags, and any environment variables needed for building the SRW App. The modulefile must be modified to include the absolute path to the user's HPC-Stack installation:

.. code-block:: console

   - This path should point to your HPCstack installation directory
   local HPCstack="/Users/username/hpc-stack/install"
   
Linux users need to configure the ``ufs-srweather-app/etc/lmod-setup.sh`` file for the ``linux`` case and set the ``BASH_ENV`` variable to point to the Lmod initialization script. There is no need to modify this script for the ``macos`` case presuming that Lmod followed a standard installation procedure using the Homebrew package manager for MacOS.

Next, users must source the Lmod setup file, just as they would on other systems, and load the modulefiles needed for building and running the SRW App:

.. code-block:: console
   
   source etc/lmod-setup.sh <platform>
   module use <path/to/ufs-srweather-app/modulefiles>
   module load build_<platform>_gnu
   export LDFLAGS+=" -L${MPI_ROOT}/lib "

In a csh/tcsh shell, users would run ``source etc/lmod-setup.csh <platform>`` in place of the first line in the code block above. The last line is primarily needed for the MacOS platforms.

Proceed to building the executables using the process outlined in :numref:`Step %s <BuildCMake>`.

Run an Experiment
=====================

To configure and run an experiment, users should proceed to :numref:`Chapter %s <RunSRW>`.
