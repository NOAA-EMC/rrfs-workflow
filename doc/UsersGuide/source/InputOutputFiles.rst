Input and Output Files
=======================
This chapter provides an overview of the input and output files needed by the components
of the UFS SRW Application. Links to more detailed documentation for each of the components (e.g., UFS_UTILS, the UFS Weather Model, and the UPP) are provided in the sections below. For SRW App users who want to jump straight to downloading and staging the required files, see :numref:`Section %s <DownloadingStagingInput>`. 

.. _Input:

Input Files
===========
The SRW Application requires numerous input files to run: static datasets (fix files
containing climatological information, terrain, and land use data), initial and boundary
conditions files, and model configuration files (such as namelists).

Initial and Boundary Condition Files
------------------------------------
The external model files needed for initializing an experiment can be obtained in a number of
ways, including: 

   * pulled directly from `NOMADS <https://nomads.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/data/nccf/com/>`__ (limited timespan for data availability),
   * pulled from the NOAA High Performance Storage System (HPSS) during the workflow execution (requires user access), or 
   * obtained and staged by the user from a different source. 

The data format for these files can be :term:`GRIB2` or :term:`NEMSIO`. More information on downloading and setting up the external model data can be found in :numref:`Section %s <DownloadingStagingInput>`. Once the data is set up, the end-to-end application will run the system and write output files to disk.

Pre-processing (UFS_UTILS)
---------------------------
When a user generates the regional workflow as described in :numref:`Section %s <GenerateWorkflow>`, the workflow generation script links the input data for the pre-processing utilities to the experiment directory. The pre-processing utilities use many different datasets to create grids and to generate model input datasets from the external model files. A detailed description of the input files for the pre-processing utilities can be found in the UFS_UTILS `Technical Documentation <https://noaa-emcufs-utils.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ and `Scientific Documentation <https://ufs-community.github.io/UFS_UTILS/index.html>`__.

UFS Weather Model
-----------------
The input files for the UFS Weather Model include both static (fixed) files and grid- and date-specific files (terrain, initial conditions, boundary conditions, etc). The static fix(ed) files
must be staged by the user unless the user is running on a `Level 1/pre-configured <https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-srweather-app/wiki/Supported-Platforms-and-Compilers>`__ platform, in which case users can link to the existing copy of the data on their machine. See :numref:`Section %s <StaticFixFiles>` for instructions. The workflow scripts link the static, grid, and date-specific files in the experiment directory. An extensive description of the input files for the Weather Model can be found in the `UFS Weather Model User's Guide <https://ufs-weather-model.readthedocs.io/en/latest/InputsOutputs.html>`__. The namelists and configuration files for the SRW Application are created from templates by the workflow generation script, as described in :numref:`Section %s <WorkflowTemplates>`.

Unified Post Processor (UPP)
----------------------------
Documentation for the UPP input files can be found in the `UPP User's Guide
<https://upp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/InputsOutputs.html#input-files>`__.

.. _WorkflowTemplates:

Workflow
---------
The SRW Application uses a series of template files, combined with user-selected settings,
to create the required namelists and parameter files needed by the SRW Application workflow. (See :numref:`Figure %s <WorkflowGeneration>` for a visual summary of the workflow generation process, including template use.) These templates can be reviewed to see which defaults are used and where configuration parameters from the ``config.yaml`` file are assigned.

List of Template Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The template files for the SRW Application are located in the ``parm`` directory
and are shown in :numref:`Table %s <TemplateFiles>`.

Migratory Route of the Input Files in the Workflow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:numref:`Figure %s <MigratoryRoute>` shows how the input files in the template directory (``ufs-srweather-app/parm``) flow to the experiment directory. First, the CCPP physics suite is specified in the configuration file. The template input files corresponding to the selected physics suite, such as ``field_table.[CCPP]`` and ``nems.configure_[CCPP]``, are copied to the experiment directory (``$EXPTDIR``). Additionally, the namelist file of the Weather Model (``input.nml``) is created from the ``input.nml.FV3`` and ``FV3.input.yml`` files by running the workflow generation script. While running the ``RUN_FCST`` task in the regional workflow as shown in :numref:`Figure %s <WorkflowTasksFig>`, the ``field_table``, ``nems.configure``, and ``input.nml`` files, located in ``$EXPTDIR``, are linked to the cycle directory (``$CYCLE_DIR``). Additionally, ``diag_table`` and ``model_configure`` are copied from the ``parm`` directory. Finally, these files are updated with the variables specified in ``var_defn.sh``.

.. _MigratoryRoute:

.. figure:: _static/SRW_wflow_input_path.png
   :alt: Flowchart showing how information from the physics suite travels from the configuration file to the setup file to the workflow generation script to the run forecast ex-script. As this information is fed from one file to the next, file paths and variables required for workflow execution are set. 

   *Migratory Route of Input Files*

.. _OutputFiles:

Output Files
==============

Output files from each workflow task are written to a subdirectory within the experiment directory (``$EXPTDIR/YYYYMMDDHH``), named based on the settings in ``config.yaml``. 

Initial and boundary condition files
------------------------------------
The external model data used by ``chgres_cube`` (as part of the pre-processing utilities) are located
in the experiment directory under ``$EXPTDIR/YYYYMMDDHH/EXTRN_MDL_NAME/{for_ICS/for_LBCS}``.

Pre-processing (UFS_UTILS)
--------------------------
The files output by the other pre-processing utilities reside in the ``INPUT`` directory under the
experiment directory (``$EXPTDIR/YYYYMMDDHH/INPUT``) and consist of the following:

* ``C403_grid.tile7.halo3.nc``
* ``gfs_bndy.tile7.HHH.nc``
* ``gfs_ctrl.nc``
* ``gfs_data.nc``
* ``gfs_data.tile7.halo0.nc``
* ``grid_spec.nc``
* ``grid.tile7.halo4.nc``
* ``oro_data.nc``
* ``oro_data.tile7.halo4.nc``
* ``sfc_data.nc -> sfc_data.tile7.halo0.nc``
* ``sfc_data.tile7.halo0.nc``
* ``tmp_ICS``
* ``tmp_LBCS``

These output files are used as inputs for the UFS Weather Model and are described in the `UFS Weather Model User's Guide 
<https://ufs-weather-model.readthedocs.io/en/latest/InputsOutputs.html#grid-description-and-initial-condition-files>`__. ``gfs_bndy.tile7.HHH.nc`` refers to a series of IC/LBC files where ``HHH`` is the 3-digit hour of the forecast. 

UFS Weather Model
------------------
As stated in :numref:`Section %s <UserSpecificConfig>`, the workflow can be run in "community" mode or "nco" mode, which determines the location and names of the output files. Weather Model output files can be in :term:`netCDF` or :term:`NEMSIO` format. The output file format is set in the ``model_configure`` file (see :numref:`Table %s <TemplateFiles>`) using the ``output_file`` variable. At this time, due to limitations in the post-processing component, only netCDF output is recommended as output for the SRW Application.

.. note::
   The fully supported options for this release include running in "community" mode with netCDF-formatted output files.

In this case, the netCDF output files are written to the ``$EXPTDIR/YYYYMMDDHH`` directory. The bases of the file names are specified in the input file ``model_configure`` and are set to the following in the SRW Application:

* ``dynfHHH.nc``
* ``phyfHHH.nc``

where ``HHH`` corresponds to the 3-digit forecast hour (e.g., ``dynf006.nc`` for the 6th hour of the forecast). Additional details may be found in the `UFS Weather Model User's Guide
<https://ufs-weather-model.readthedocs.io/en/latest/InputsOutputs.html#output-files>`__.

Unified Post Processor (UPP)
----------------------------
Documentation for the UPP output files can be found in the `UPP User's Guide <https://upp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/InputsOutputs.html>`__.

For the SRW Application, the Weather Model netCDF output files are written to ``$EXPTDIR/YYYYMMDDHH/postprd`` and have the naming convention (file->linked to):

* ``NATLEV_{YY}{JJJ}{hh}{mm}f{fhr}00 -> {domain}.t{cyc}z.natlevf{fhr}.tmXX.grib2``
* ``PRSLEV_{YY}{JJJ}{hh}{mm}f{fhr}00 -> {domain}.t{cyc}z.prslevf{fhr}.tmXX.grib2``

The default setting for the output file names uses ``rrfs`` for ``{domain}``. This may be overridden by the user in the ``config.yaml`` settings.

.. _ModifyUPPOutput:

Modifying the UPP Output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If users wish to modify the fields or levels that are output from the UPP, they will need to make modifications to ``fv3lam.xml``, which resides in the UPP repository distributed with the UFS SRW Application. If the code was cloned into the directory ``ufs-srweather-app``, the file will be located in ``ufs-srweather-app/sorc/UPP/parm``.

.. note::
   This process requires advanced knowledge of which fields can be output for the UFS Weather Model.

UPP Product Output Tables for the UFS SRW LAM Grid:
   * :doc:`3D Native Hybrid Level Fields <tables/SRW_NATLEV_table>`
   * :doc:`3D Pressure Level Fields <tables/SRW_PRSLEV_table>`

Use the instructions in the `UPP User's Guide <https://upp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/InputsOutputs.html#control-file>`__ to make modifications to the ``fv3lam.xml`` file and to remake the flat text file, called ``postxconfig-NT-fv3lam.txt`` (default), that the UPP reads.

After creating the new flat text file to reflect the changes, users will need to modify their ``config.yaml`` to point the workflow to the new text file. In ``config.yaml``, set the following:

.. code-block:: console

   USE_CUSTOM_POST_CONFIG_FILE: true
   CUSTOM_POST_CONFIG_FP: </path/to/custom/postxconfig-NT-fv3lam.txt>

which tells the workflow to use the custom file located in the user-defined path. The path should include the filename. If ``USE_CUSTOM_POST_CONFIG_FILE`` is set to true, but the file path is not found, then an error will occur when trying to generate the SRW Application workflow.

Users may then start their experiment workflow as usual, and the UPP will use the new flat ``*.txt`` file.

.. _SatelliteProducts:

Outputting Satellite Products from UPP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Synthetic satellite products for several instruments and channels (e.g., GOES 16/17) may be output through the UPP using the Community Radiative Transfer Model (:term:`CRTM`). External CRTM coefficient files, available through the UPP stand-alone release, will need to be manually downloaded before running the workflow. These instructions assume that the UPP configuration file (``postxconfig-NT-fv3lam.txt``) has already been set up to output satellite products using the process described above in :numref:`Section %s<ModifyUPPOutput>`.

Download and unpack the external files:

.. code-block:: console

   mkdir crtm && cd crtm
   wget https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/UPP/releases/download/upp_v11.0.0/fix.tar.gz
   tar -xzf fix.tar.gz

Modify the ``config.yaml`` file to include the following lines:

.. code-block:: console

   USE_CRTM: true
   CRTM_DIR: </path/to/top/crtm/dir>

By setting ``USE_CRTM`` to true, the workflow will use the path defined in ``CRTM_DIR`` to link the necessary coefficient files to the working directory at runtime. Otherwise, it is assumed that no satellite fields are being requested in the UPP configuration. ``CRTM_DIR`` should point to the top CRTM directory where the fix files are located.

.. note::
   Dependencies for outputting synthetic satellite products may exist based on model configuration (e.g., model physics).


.. _DownloadingStagingInput:

Downloading and Staging Input Data
==================================
A set of input files, including static (fix) data and raw initial and lateral boundary conditions (:term:`IC/LBCs`), is required to run the SRW Application. The data required for the "out-of-the-box" SRW App case described in Chapters :numref:`%s <QuickstartC>` and :numref:`%s <RunSRW>` is already preinstalled on `Level 1 & 2 <https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-srweather-app/wiki/Supported-Platforms-and-Compilers>`__ systems, along with data required to run the :ref:`WE2E <WE2E_tests>` test cases. Therefore, users on these systems do not need to stage the fixed files manually because they have been prestaged, and the paths are set in ``ush/setup.sh``. Users on Level 3 & 4 systems can find the most recent SRW App release data in the `UFS SRW Application Data Bucket <https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-ufs-shortrangeweather/>`__ by clicking on `Browse Bucket <https://noaa-ufs-srw-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html>`__. 

.. _StaticFixFiles:

Static Files
--------------

Static files are available in the `"fix" directory <https://noaa-ufs-srw-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#fix/>`__ of the SRW App Data Bucket. Users can download the full set of fix files as a tar file:

.. code-block:: console

   wget https://noaa-ufs-srw-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/current_srw_release_data/fix_data.tgz
   tar -xzf fix_data.tgz

Alternatively, users can download the static files individually from the `"fix" directory <https://noaa-ufs-srw-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#fix/>`__ of the SRW Data Bucket using the ``wget`` command for each required file. A list of ``wget`` commands with links is provided :ref:`here <StaticFilesList>` for the release v2.1.0 fix file data. Users will need to create an appropriate directory structure for the files when downloading them individually. The best solution is to download the files into directories that mirror the structure of the `Data Bucket <https://noaa-ufs-srw-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html>`__. 

The environment variables ``FIXgsm``, ``TOPO_DIR``, and ``SFC_CLIMO_INPUT_DIR`` indicate the path to the directories where the static files are located. After downloading the experiment data, users must set the paths to the files in ``config.yaml``. Add the following code to the ``task_run_fcst:`` section of the ``config.yaml`` file, and alter the variable paths accordingly:

.. code-block:: console

   FIXgsm: </path-to/fix/fix_am>
   TOPO_DIR: </path-to/fix/fix_am/fix_orog>
   SFC_CLIMO_INPUT_DIR: </path-to/fix_am/fix/sfc_climo/>

.. _InitialConditions:

Initial Condition/Lateral Boundary Condition File Formats and Source
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The SRW Application currently supports raw initial and lateral boundary conditions from numerous models (i.e., FV3GFS, GEFS, GDAS, NAM, RAP, HRRR). The data can be provided in three formats: :term:`NEMSIO`, :term:`netCDF`, or :term:`GRIB2`. 

To download the model input data for the 12-hour "out-of-the-box" experiment configuration in ``config.community.yaml`` file, run:

.. code-block:: console

   wget https://noaa-ufs-srw-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/current_srw_release_data/gst_data.tgz
   tar -xzf gst_data.tgz

To download data for different dates, model types, and formats, users can explore the ``input_model_data`` section of the data bucket and replace the links above with ones that fetch their desired data. 

.. _ICS-LBCS:

Initial and Lateral Boundary Condition Organization
----------------------------------------------------

The paths to ``EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_ICS`` and ``EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_LBCS`` must be set in the appropriate sections of the ``config.yaml`` file:

.. code-block:: console

   task_get_extrn_ics:
      USE_USER_STAGED_EXTRN_FILES: true
      EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_ICS: <path/to/ufs-srweather-app/input_model_data/FV3GFS/grib2/YYYYMMDDHH>
      EXTRN_MDL_DATA_STORES: disk
   task_get_extrn_lbcs:
      USE_USER_STAGED_EXTRN_FILES: true
      EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_LBCS: <path/to/ufs-srweather-app/input_model_data/FV3GFS/grib2/YYYYMMDDHH>
      EXTRN_MDL_DATA_STORES: disk

The two ``EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_*CS`` variables describe where the :term:`IC <ICs>` and :term:`LBC <LBCs>` file directories are located, respectively. For ease of reusing ``config.yaml`` across experiments, it is recommended that users set up the raw :term:`IC/LBC <IC/LBCs>` file paths to include the model name (e.g., FV3GFS, GEFS, GDAS, NAM, RAP, HRRR), data format (e.g., grib2, nemsio), and date (in ``YYYYMMDDHH`` format). For example: ``/path-to/input_model_data/FV3GFS/grib2/2019061518/``. While there is flexibility to modify these settings, this structure will provide the most reusability for multiple dates when using the SRW Application workflow.

When files are pulled from NOAA :term:`HPSS` (rather than downloaded from the data bucket), the naming convention looks something like:

* FV3GFS (GRIB2): ``gfs.t{cycle}z.pgrb2.0p25.f{fhr}``
* FV3GFS (NEMSIO): 

   * ICs: ``gfs.t{cycle}z.atmanl.nemsio`` and ``gfs.t{cycle}z.sfcanl.nemsio``;
   * LBCs: ``gfs.t{cycle}z.atmf{fhr}.nemsio``

* GDAS (NETCDF):  

   * ICs: ``gdas.t{cycle}z.atmf{fhr}.nc`` and ``gdas.t{cycle}z.sfcf{fhr}.nc``;
   * LBCs: ``gdas.t{cycle}z.atmf{fhr}.nc``

* RAP (GRIB2): ``rap.t{cycle}z.wrfprsf{fhr}.grib2``
* HRRR (GRIB2): ``hrrr.t{cycle}z.wrfprsf{fhr}.grib2``

where:

   * ``{cycle}`` corresponds to the 2-digit hour of the day when the forecast cycle starts, and 
   * ``{fhr}`` corresponds to the 2- or 3-digit nth hour of the forecast (3-digits for FV3GFS/GDAS data and 2 digits for RAP/HRRR data). 

For example, a forecast using FV3GFS GRIB2 data that starts at 18h00 UTC would have a {cycle} value of 18, which is the 000th forecast hour. The LBCS file for 21h00 UTC would be named ``gfs.t18z.pgrb2.0p25.f003``. 

In some cases, it may be necessary to specify values for ``EXTRN_MDL_FILES_*CS`` variables. This is often the case with HRRR and RAP data. An example ``config.yaml`` excerpt using HRRR and RAP data appears below: 

.. code-block:: console

   task_get_extrn_ics:
      EXTRN_MDL_NAME_ICS: HRRR
      USE_USER_STAGED_EXTRN_FILES: true
      EXTRN_MDL_FILES_ICS:
         - '{yy}{jjj}{hh}00{fcst_hr:02d}00'
   task_get_extrn_lbcs:
      EXTRN_MDL_NAME_LBCS: RAP
      LBC_SPEC_INTVL_HRS: 3
      USE_USER_STAGED_EXTRN_FILES: true
      EXTRN_MDL_FILES_LBCS:
         - '{yy}{jjj}{hh}00{fcst_hr:02d}00'

Default Initial and Lateral Boundary Conditions
-----------------------------------------------

The default initial and lateral boundary condition files are set to be a severe weather case from June 15, 2019 (20190615) at 18 UTC. FV3GFS GRIB2 files are the default model and file format. A tar file
(``gst_data.tgz``) containing the model data for this case is available in the `UFS SRW App Data Bucket <https://noaa-ufs-srw-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#current_srw_release_data/>`__. 

Running the App for Different Dates
-----------------------------------
If users want to run the SRW Application for dates other than June 15-16, 2019, they will need to modify the ``config.yaml`` settings, including the ``DATE_FIRST_CYCL`` and ``DATE_LAST_CYCL`` variables. The forecast length can be modified by changing the ``FCST_LEN_HRS``. In addition, the lateral boundary interval can be specified using the ``LBC_SPEC_INTVL_HRS`` variable.

Users will need to ensure that the initial and lateral boundary condition files are available
in the specified path for their new date, cycle, and forecast length.

Staging Initial Conditions Manually
-----------------------------------
If users want to run the SRW Application with raw model files for dates other than those that
are currently available on the preconfigured platforms, they need to stage the data manually.
The data should be placed in ``EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_ICS`` and ``EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_LBCS`` (which may be the same directory). The path to these variables can be set in the ``config.yaml`` file as shown :ref:`above <ICS-LBCS>`. Raw model files are available from a number of sources. A few examples are provided here for convenience.

Coexistence of Multiple Files for the Same Date
-------------------------------------------------
It is recommended that users have a separate directory for each file format if they choose to store files in multiple formats (e.g., GRIB2, NEMSIO, netCDF) for the same date. For example, the directory structure for a user storing GFS GRIB2 and NEMSIO files might resemble the following:

.. code-block:: console

   /path-to/input_model_data/FV3GFS/grib2/YYYYMMDDHH
   /path-to/input_model_data/FV3GFS/nemsio/YYYYMMDDHH

Additionally, users must set the following environment variables if they plan to use GRIB2-formatted files for FV3GFS:

.. code-block:: console

   FV3GFS_FILE_FMT_ICS: grib2
   FV3GFS_FILE_FMT_LBCS: grib2

This is ONLY necessary when using FV3GFS GRIB2 files. These settings may be removed when initializing from the default NEMSIO format for FV3GFS files.

Best Practices for Conserving Disk Space and Keeping Files Safe
---------------------------------------------------------------
Initial and lateral boundary condition files are large and can occupy a significant amount of
disk space. If several users will employ a common file system to run forecasts, it is recommended
that the users share the same ``EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_ICS`` and ``EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_LBCS``
directories. That way, if raw model input files are already on disk for a given date, they do not
need to be replicated.

The files in the subdirectories of the ``EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_ICS`` and ``EXTRN_MDL_SOURCE_BASEDIR_LBCS`` directories should be write-protected. This prevents these files from being accidentally modified or deleted. The directories should generally be group-writable so the directory can be shared among multiple users.
