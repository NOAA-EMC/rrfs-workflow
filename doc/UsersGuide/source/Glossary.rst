   advect
      To transport substances in the atmostphere by :term:`advection`.

   advection
      According to the American Meteorological Society (AMS) `definition <https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Advection>`__, advection is "The process of transport of an atmospheric property solely by the mass motion (velocity field) of the atmosphere." In common parlance, advection is movement of atmospheric substances that are carried around by the wind.

The CMAQ, treated as a column chemistry model, updates concentrations of chemical species (e.g., ozone and aerosol compositions) at each integration time step. The transport terms (e.g., :term:`advection` and diffusion) of all chemical species are handled by the UFS Weather Model as :term:`tracers<tracer>`.

   CAM
   convection-allowing models
      Convection-allowing models (CAMs) are models that run on high-resolution grids (usually with grid spacing at 4km or less). They are able to resolve the effects of small-scale convective processes. They typically run several times a day to provide frequent forecasts (e.g., hourly or subhourly). 

   cycle

   cycle-dependent 
      Describes a workflow task that needs to be run at the start of each :term:`cycle` of an experiment.
   
   cycle-independent
      Describes a workflow task that only needs to be run once per experiment, regardless of the number of cycles in the experiment.
   
   data assimilation
      Data assimilation is the process of combining observations, model data, and error statistics to achieve the best estimate of the state of a system. One of the major sources of error in weather and climate forecasts is uncertainty related to the initial conditions that are used to generate future predictions. Even the most precise instruments have a small range of unavoidable measurement error, which means that tiny measurement errors (e.g., related to atmospheric conditions and instrument location) can compound over time. These small differences result in very similar forecasts in the short term (i.e., minutes, hours), but they cause widely divergent forecasts in the long term. Errors in weather and climate forecasts can also arise because models are imperfect representations of reality. Data assimilation systems seek to mitigate these problems by combining the most timely observational data with a "first guess" of the atmospheric state (usually a previous forecast) and other sources of data to provide a "best guess" analysis of the atmospheric state to start a weather or climate simulation. When combined with an "ensemble" of model runs (many forecasts with slightly different conditions), data assimilation helps predict a range of possible atmospheric states, giving an overall measure of uncertainty in a given forecast.
